# Zoological Park Hotspots
## Summary
This project utilizes community science observations of butterflies to compare biodiversity in zoological parks to that of their surounding urban environments in the southwestern United States of America. It used species richness and Shannon's Index of diversity in order to demonstrate how zoos can serve as biodiversity hotspots for pollinators in urban areas.
